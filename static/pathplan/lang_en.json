    "intro_text": "This data is specifically created for the classification training of robot time-series data. In response to the phenomena in existing time-series data datasets, such as short time series and data contamination. This dataset involves 6 six-axis robots of different types performing different tasks at different speeds. Approximately 200 million data records are finally collected. Each data record includes information on the torque, rotational position, and angular velocity of each axis of the robot at a single time point.",
